# Jonny
AI-Powered Platform "Jonny" for Detecting Route Infractions
## Summary

This project aims to develop an AI-powered platform named "Jonny" that detects route infractions. By analyzing vehicle movement and identifying patterns indicative of route violations, the system alerts authorities for further investigation and action.
## Background

Route infractions are a significant issue in transportation, leading to traffic congestion, accidents, and legal violations. This project aims to mitigate these risks by providing a tool that detects route violations in real-time, helping authorities enforce traffic rules and ensure road safety.

    Traffic congestion
    Increased accident rates
    Legal violations

## How is it used?

The AI platform "Jonny" is used by transportation authorities to monitor vehicle movements for route infractions. The process involves:

    Data Collection: Gathering data on vehicle movements and routes.
    Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
    Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features for the neural network.
    Model Training: Training the neural network to detect route violations.
    Model Evaluation: Testing the model's accuracy and efficiency.
    Model Implementation: Deploying the model to detect route infractions in real-time.

This is how you create code examples:

python

import numpy as np
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense

# Load and preprocess the data
X_train = np.load('X_train.npy')
y_train = np.load('y_train.npy')
X_test = np.load('X_test.npy')
y_test = np.load('y_test.npy')

# Create the neural network model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=X_train.shape[1], activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compile the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Evaluate the model
loss, acc = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test, verbose=0)
print('Test Accuracy: %.3f' % acc)

## Data sources and AI methods

The data comes from vehicle movement records provided by transportation authorities and GPS data. The platform uses machine learning algorithms and neural networks to analyze the data and detect route infractions.

Challenges

The project does not solve all aspects of route enforcement and has limitations such as access to real-time movement data and potential privacy concerns. Ethical considerations include ensuring data privacy and compliance with legal regulations.
## What next?

To advance the project, further skills in AI, machine learning, data analytics, and cybersecurity are needed. Collaboration with transportation authorities, GPS service providers, and regulatory bodies is essential for success.
